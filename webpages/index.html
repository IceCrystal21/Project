                    <p>So today was my first day at work, and I was late. Not by a little, like “oops, five minutes,” but enough that I was panicking in the car. My alarm went off late, I spilled my coffee, and traffic was terrible. By the time I got there, I was sweating and embarrassed. I walked in hoping nobody would notice, but my boss saw me immediately. I mumbled an apology, trying not to look like I’d just run a marathon. Everyone else was already at their desks, looking calm and professional, while I was mentally kicking myself for not leaving earlier. Honestly, I just want to survive this week without making any more mistakes. First impressions matter, right? So now I’m triple-checking alarms, planning my morning better, and thinking maybe I should buy a second coffee mug just in case. Lesson learned: mornings are harder than they look.</p>

                    <div class="banner" id="life-banner"><h2>No more ramen</h2></div>
                    <p>My microwave broke today. Yeah… it’s gone. That little machine that made life easy, especially late-night ramen, is officially dead. I feel a little lost because I basically relied on it for survival food. I know it’s silly, but this is a real problem. Now I either have to cook, wait for food to cool down, or find some new quick meal option. None of those sound appealing. Ramen was simple, fast, and basically my fallback for everything. I guess it’s time to grow up a little and figure out something else to eat. Or maybe just start saving for a new microwave… that seems easier. Until then, I might have to live off sandwiches or cereal like a normal person. Which is… sad.</p>

                    <div class="banner" id="rant-banner"><h2>TF are anteaters?</h2></div>
                    <p>I was reading about anteaters today. And honestly, I don’t get the name. Their whole identity is literally based on what they eat. “Hi, I’m Anteater.” Cool, thanks for that. Also, ants? Really? You eat tiny ants all day? I can barely deal with bugs outside my house. And now there’s this animal that lives off them? Weird. It made me think: animals have some funny names sometimes. Like koalas eat leaves, pandas eat bamboo… why not name them after their hobbies or favorite snacks? Humans would probably be named the same way. Imagine introducing yourself as “Hi, I’m PizzaEater.” Somehow, it feels awkward. </p>
